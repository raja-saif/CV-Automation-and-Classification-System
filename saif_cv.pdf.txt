PROJECTS:
EDUCATION
TECHNICAL SKILLS
MNIST Neural Network Acceleration on GPU (C/CUDA)
Implemented a GPU-accelerated neural network for MNIST digit classification using CUDA in C/C++.
Optimized matrix operations with custom CUDA kernels for parallel training and inference, achieving
significant runtime reduction over CPU-based approaches.
Autonomous Driving Model for TORCS (Python, LSTM)
Developed an LSTM-based behavioral cloning model for autonomous driving in the TORCS simulator.
Automated telemetry data collection to build a dataset of 1M+ samples, enabling the model to learn
control strategies and race competitively against AI opponents.
IPFS-Based Distributed File Storage using Ring DHT (C++, SHA-1, B-Trees)
Implemented a simplified IPFS model using a configurable Ring DHT with SHA-1-based content
addressing. Simulated geo-distributed file storage across machines, using B-Trees for local indexing and
modular routing tables for efficient O(log⁡(N)) lookup. Supported real-time file insertion/removal, dynamic
node joining/leaving, and complete path traceability across the network.
Online Quiz Management System (Django, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JS)
Built a full-stack web platform to support automated quiz scheduling, grading, and performance tracking.
Integrated Django for the backend and SQLite for persistent storage; designed responsive UI for seamless
teacher-student interaction.
GYM Autonomous System (JavaFX, FXML, JavaScript)
Created a desktop application for gym activity tracking. Enabled user registration, personalized training
plans, and trainer-student management. Employed JavaFX with FXML for the UI and Java for backend
logic, simulating real-world system automation.
Parallel IST Construction in Bubble-Sort Networks (C++, OpenMP, MPI, METIS)
Engineered a fully parallel algorithm (complexity O(n⋅n!)) for constructing independent spanning trees in
Bubble-Sort Networks. Utilized OpenMP and MPI for hybrid parallelism and METIS for optimized graph
partitioning, demonstrating scalable high-performance computing.
